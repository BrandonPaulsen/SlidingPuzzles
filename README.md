# Sliding Puzzles

An A* implementation to solve 8 puzzles. Analyzed visited nodes vs solution depth, maximum frontier size vs solution depth, and search time vs solution depth via a monte carlo simulation on 10% of the number of solvable states of the 8 puzzle. Code is available both in C++ and Python.
